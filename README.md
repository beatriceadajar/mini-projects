# mini-projects
A repository of random mini-projects that I've done in my spare time.

Here is a list of all the projects, in order:
1. wordscapes-solutions
2. postpaid-plans

Each project is organized into its own folder, with the necessary README file for more information and a requirements file for all the used packages.
