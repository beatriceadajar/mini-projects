# wordscapes-solutions

## Description

This is a simple Python application that, given an alphabet and either the length of the word or a pattern of letters, can generate possible answers.

Note that the source for checking whether a string is a valid word or not is NLTK WordNet. Thus, some words that are included in the results may not be accepted by the Wordscapes app.

## Instructions

Install the necessary requirements. You may choose to make a virtual environment or not. Simply enter the following command on the terminal in the directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start the application, run the following:

```bash
python -m wordscapes
```
